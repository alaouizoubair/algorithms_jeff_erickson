# Game Tree Algorithm

## Preface
This series of algorithms is based on and inspired by Jeff Erickson's book: Algorithms. All my thanks go to him and his team.
On the other hand, I hope you would join in enriching this series by adding other languages and benchmarking performance.
Leave me some comments, I will gladely respond to any raised issues and answer your questions.


## Introduction
This is a two-player game played on a n x n square grid with a border of squares.
Player 1 start with n token on the top of the grid, while player B starts on the left with same number of tokens.
In each turn, player A can move one token down if the square is empty, or jump to the next square if player B's token is ahead of it. A player can't jump two squares and move three steps ahead.
Once the game is launched, the program will determin the number of possibilities each player has to win the game based on who starts first.
